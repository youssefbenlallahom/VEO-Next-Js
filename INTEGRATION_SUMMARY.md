# Backend Integration Summary

## What Has Been Changed

I've modified your existing job detail view to fetch real data from your Python backend instead of using hardcoded data. Here's what's different:

### 1. **New Hook for Backend Data** (`hooks/use-candidate-reports.ts`)
- `useCandidateReports(jobTitle)` - Fetches candidate reports for a specific job from your backend
- `mergeCandidateWithReport()` - Merges frontend candidate data with backend AI reports

### 2. **Modified Job Detail View** (`components/job-detail-view.tsx`)

#### **AI Score Display:**
- **Before**: Always showed hardcoded aiScore (like 8.5/10)
- **After**: 
  - Shows real score from backend if AI analysis exists
  - Shows "Not Analyzed" badge if no AI report exists

#### **AI Report Button:**
- **Before**: Always clickable for all candidates
- **After**: 
  - Clickable "AI Report" button for analyzed candidates
  - Disabled "Not Analyzed" button for unanalyzed candidates

#### **AI Report Content:**
- **Before**: Generated fake data (skills breakdown, recommendations)
- **After**: Shows real data from your backend:
  - Real strengths from `report.strengths`
  - Real gaps from `report.gaps`
  - Real score details from `report.score_details`
  - Report date and ID information

#### **Statistics Panel:**
- **Before**: Calculated averages from fake scores
- **After**: 
  - Shows count of analyzed vs unanalyzed candidates
  - Calculates average only from real analyzed scores
  - Shows "No data" when no analyses exist

### 3. **Data Flow**

```
Job Detail Page
    ↓
1. Fetch job candidates (existing)
2. Fetch AI reports from backend (new)
    ↓
3. Merge candidates with their reports
    ↓
4. Display:
   - Real scores for analyzed candidates
   - "Not Analyzed" for others
```

## **How It Works**

1. **When you open a job detail page:**
   - Frontend fetches candidates (as before)
   - **NEW**: Frontend searches your backend for AI reports matching the job title
   - Candidates are merged with their reports (if they exist)

2. **For candidates with AI reports:**
   - Shows real AI score
   - "AI Report" button is clickable
   - Displays real strengths, gaps, and score details

3. **For candidates without AI reports:**
   - Shows "Not Analyzed" badge
   - "Not Analyzed" button is disabled
   - No AI report can be viewed

## **Backend Requirements**

Your Python backend should be running with these endpoints working:
- `GET /candidates/search?job_title=JobTitle` - Returns candidates with reports for that job

## **Configuration**

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## **Testing**

1. Start your Python backend
2. Start the Next.js frontend (`npm run dev`)
3. Navigate to any job detail page
4. You should see:
   - Real scores for candidates who have been analyzed
   - "Not Analyzed" for candidates without AI reports
   - Real AI report data when clicking on analyzed candidates

## **What This Achieves**

✅ **No more hardcoded data** - All AI scores and reports come from your real backend
✅ **Clear status indication** - Users can see which candidates have been analyzed
✅ **Real analysis data** - Strengths, gaps, and scores from your actual AI analysis
✅ **Seamless integration** - Works with your existing job and candidate structure

The frontend now perfectly reflects the state of your backend database - showing real analysis results when available and clearly indicating when candidates haven't been analyzed yet!
