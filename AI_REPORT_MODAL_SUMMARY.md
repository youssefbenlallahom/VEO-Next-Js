# AI Report Modal Implementation Summary

## âœ… **What I've Implemented:**

### 1. **AI Report Modal Component** (`components/ai-report-modal.tsx`)
- **Beautiful popup design** similar to the CV viewer
- **Visual score breakdown** with progress bars and cards
- **Strengths and gaps** displayed in attractive colored boxes
- **Score details** formatted beautifully instead of raw JSON
- **Final recommendation** with emoji indicators

### 2. **Updated Job Detail View**
- **Removed inline AI report** - No more cluttered page
- **Added modal integration** - Clean popup experience  
- **Better state management** - Passes full candidate object to modal

## ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Improvements:**

### **Before:**
```
